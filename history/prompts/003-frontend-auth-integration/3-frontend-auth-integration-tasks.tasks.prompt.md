  - Phase 3: User Story 1 (Authentication - sign up/in)
  - Phase 4: User Story 2 (Task Management - CRUD operations)
  - Phase 5: User Story 3 (Secure Data Access - user isolation)
  - Phase 6: User Story 4 (Responsive UI - mobile/desktop)
  - Phase 7: Interactive Glow Effects implementation
  - Phase 8: Polish and cross-cutting concerns

  Tasks are organized by user story priority and include dependencies and parallel execution opportunities.
